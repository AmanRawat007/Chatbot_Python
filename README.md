1.1 Abstract-
In this project, we implement an E-mail Management Assistant System that mimics the features of a personal assistant. A personal assistant is usually someone who tailors it’s function according to individual’s needs and demands. This can be attained by using rule based systems. It is a set of "if-then" statements that uses a set of assertions, which decided based on rules how to act upon those assertions which are created. Such system that works on Rule based systems and emulates human reasoning provided with adequate knowledge is called an expert system. We plan to implement an email personal assistant system with the knowledge of rule based and expert systems and forward chaining rules. Furthermore, our email manager is a system that addresses the process of e-mail management, from initially sorting messages into virtual folders, to prioritizing, reading, replying (automatically or semi-automatically), archiving and deleting mail items.

1.2	Rule Based systems-
Rule Based systems are used to store manipulate knowledge to interpret information in useful way.  The set of ‘if-then’ rules are assertions based on knowledge, this way information is put to good use, e.g – an email from facebook would be classified under Social, this classification is based on, facebook is a social networking site, although an exception to this rule would be if the Subject of the e-mail has content like ‘Reset Password’ or ’Unidentified Log in’ etc.

1.3	Expert System-
Expert Systemis a computer system that emulates decision making ability of humans based on reasoning, represented mainly as mant ‘if-then’ rules. This helps provide personalized recommendation according to user’s tone, personality, and requirement.
A expert system is divided into two subsystems:  the inference system and knowledge base. Knowledge base represents facts and rules.  The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.

1.4	Conclusion-
In conclusionwe use rule based and expert based systems together to build an assistant which emulates human behavior and knowledge representation which is easily accessible(just like human memory).
